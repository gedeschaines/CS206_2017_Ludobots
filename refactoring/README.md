### Pyrosim Project Executables

1. The Python program **search.py** file simulates a single synapse virtual robot neural network depicted in the engineering diagram image **eng_drawing.png** file (shown above) as detailed in Ludobots Pyrosim project: [Refactoring](https://www.reddit.com/r/ludobots/wiki/pyrosim/refactoring).
2. The Python program **ransomSearch.py** file simulates the same single synapse virtual robot neural network as **search.py** but utilizes the random search algorithm as detailed in Ludobots Pyrosim project: [Random Search](https://www.reddit.com/r/ludobots/wiki/pyrosim/randomsearch).
